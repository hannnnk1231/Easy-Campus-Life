I would be taking the demos according to your convenience after your quiz.
Couple of pointers:
* Please join in the Zoom call about 5 minutes before your slot.
* It is your responsibility to make sure that you are in a position to present (audio, screen sharing issues, being in a quiet environment, etc have to be taken care of before you join the call) - We cannot waste our as well as other students’ time due to your negligence.
* Co-ordinate with your partner before the demo
